### 1. FORCE-SUB 📢: 
<i>You can add one or multiple force-sub channels—there's no limit to the number you can add. You can also empty the list by deleting all force-sub channels. This feature provides versatility, allowing you to create a custom number of force-sub channels according to your preference.</i>

### 2. ADMINS 👮🏻‍♂️: 
<i>You can add one or multiple admins by providing their user IDs, and you can also remove all admins if needed. Admins have access to some useful bot commands but do not have access to all commands.</i>

### 3. BAN 🚫: 
<i>You can add user IDs to a banned list, preventing those who annoy you or spam the bot from using it. They will be unable to access the bot until you remove them from the banned list.</i>

### 4. AUTO-DELETE 🗑⏱: 
<i>This feature is crucial for protecting the bot from copyright strikes and reducing the risk of being banned from Telegram. It includes two options: first, you can enable or disable the auto-delete mode; second, you can set a timer, so files will be automatically deleted after a specified period. After that it also send a message that shows the "previous message was deleted" and provide the link to retrieve again the same files.</i>

### 5. CONTENT BUTTON ⚪️: 
<i>This feature allows you to add customizable buttons to files shared by the bot. Every file shared by the bot will have a button, which you can tailor to meet your specific needs.</i>

### 6. SET BUTTON 🔘: 
<i>This feature allows you to customize the content buttons on files shared by the bot. For example, you can set the button name and link. You could create a button labeled "Join Channel," which will appear on the files and contain a specific link provided by you.</i>

### 7. HIDE CAPTION & PROTECT CONTENT 🫥🔒:
<i>The "Hide Caption" feature allows you to remove the caption from shared files, while the "Protect Content" feature secures the files. If you enable "Protect Content," the files cannot be forwarded by users.</i>

### 8. DATABASE 💾:
<i>All the features mentioned above are stored permanently in the database, meaning the data will remain unchanged until you decide to modify it.</i>

### <i>🚀 In addition to the above, more user-friendly and advanced interaction features have been added.</i>
